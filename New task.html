    <h3><i>My Travel Blog</i></h3>
    <div>
        <p>as someone who has devoured travel blogs (as a reader!) for decades I would recommend you only start a travel blog if you are actually traveling or passionate about a specific destination or aspect of traveling. I am a digital nomad and I travel a lot so what I am interested in reading is other people's experiences in places that I plan to visit. And for the kind of travel I do (extremely minimalistic, frugal, one bag pack packing, into alternative - queer - underground scene) there's still very little info available online, especially for smaller destinations.
